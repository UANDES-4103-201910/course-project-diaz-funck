Summary of Implemented Features:

* General site layout which includes a header navbar, space for side bars to the left and right, and the main content in the middle. The options presented by the navbar vary according to user privileges, which for the moment have to be manually edited in the ApplicationController.

* Home page for guests and registered users. The registered user home page is dynamically loaded with, for now, every post in the database.

* Administration page which includes the user administration tool and the post dumpster. Users and posts are dynamically loaded, but no interaction is possible yet.

* Signup and Login pages with placeholder forms.

* Legal page for displaying of the AUP and ToS.

Summary of Pending Features:

* Working forms.

* User session handling for displaying of user-specific content.
